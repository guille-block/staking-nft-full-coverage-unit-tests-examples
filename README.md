# Full coverage unit test examples

## Motivation
The idea is to showcase using a staking NFT project how to unit tests should be done and in which extent. This project was also used under vertigo mutation tests and slither cases

## Test
After making sure you have foundry forge installed. Execute the following commands to build the project and check the coverage the tests provide of the project:

```
forge build

forge coverage
```
